# Language Translator using NLP

## Project Overview
This project is a **language translation tool** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It takes input text in one language and translates it into another using an advanced translation model.

## Features
- Supports multiple languages for translation.
- Uses a **pre-trained NLP model** for accurate translations.
- Simple and intuitive **Streamlit frontend** for user interaction.
- Fast and efficient processing of text data.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translator.git
   cd language-translator
   ```


## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Enter the text and select source and target languages.
3. Click "Translate" to get the translated text.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Pre-trained Translation Models (e.g., Google Translate API, Hugging Face Transformers)**
- **Streamlit** (for frontend UI)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for text processing)

## Future Enhancements
- Improve translation accuracy with fine-tuned transformer models.
- Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform.
